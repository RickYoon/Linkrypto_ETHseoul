### Background: LSD Summer in DeFi Sector

Since the Ethereum Shapella upgrade in April of this year, the LSD market has seen increasing competition among various entities to attract liquidity, driven by expectations of a 20 trillion USD market with staking opportunities. This competition has opened up numerous opportunities for investors to achieve higher returns.

### Problems: Increasing Complexity of Optimal Investments for General Investors

As the number of protocols and complex money lego cases continues to grow, the number of possible investment combinations has exceeded 200. This makes it difficult for general investors to perform optimal investment evaluations. Additionally, even if they manage to identify optimal investments, the profitability may change over time, requiring constant monitoring from users.

## Why the graph ?

DeFi yields in the DeFi sector constantly fluctuate due to various factors. 
However, most DeFi protocol pages only provide users with the current rate of return, which can be risky to rely on when making investment decisions. 
There is a significant risk in basing investment decisions solely on the current rate of return, especially when DeFi yields can fluctuate by over 100%.

To address this issue, we utilize subgraphs in our asset management service. 
Through subgraphs, we collect and visualize the historical yield trends of protocols. 
y incorporating this trend data into our service, we enable users to make more accurate predictions about the potential yields they can expect.
